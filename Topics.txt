Solve a differential equation analytically by using the dsolve function, with or without initial conditions.
====
First-Order
-------------------------
First, represent y by using syms to create the symbolic function y(t).

syms y(t)

Define the equation using == and represent differentiation using the diff function.

ode = diff(y,t) == t*y
ode(t) =
diff(y(t), t) == t*y(t)

Solve the equation using dsolve.

ySol(t) = dsolve(ode)
ySol(t) =
C1*exp(t^2/2)

Solve Differential Equation with Condition
-------------------------------------
In the previous solution, the constant C1 appears because no condition was specified. Solve the equation with the initial condition y(0) == 2. The dsolve function finds a value of C1 that satisfies the condition.

cond = y(0) == 2;
ySol(t) = dsolve(ode,cond)
ySol(t) =
2*exp(t^2/2)
